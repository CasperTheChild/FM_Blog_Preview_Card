## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Transition
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree?query=figtree) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned how to use transitions, and became a bit more confident with css and html.

```html
<h1>Used variables for the first time</h1>
```
```css
:root {
  --Yellow-123: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --Gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --Gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}
```

### Continued development

I am not sure did I use em and rem properties good enough in describing font-sizes and shapes. I would like to practise on it further.
